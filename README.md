# Livestream-Info-Updater
A simple web app to update livestream meta info like stream title and category

# The Plan

* write a simple local webpage/app that will connect to YT, Twitch, and Kick
* Will probably have to setup dev creds and document how to setup in this readme.
* store as much on localstorage as possible 
* using copilot as much as possible to battle test it.
* using html, create a stream title input, making sure to accept emojis
* submit button to update YT
* ...tbd


# Setup instructions for YT
* follow directions here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/live/getting-started
* HIGHLY recommend restricting your API Key to just YT API v3
